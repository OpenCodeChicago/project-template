# Project Architecture

This document provides an overview of the project’s architecture.
Each project created from this template should update this file to describe its specific design decisions.

## Folder Structure

- `.github/` — GitHub configuration, issue and PR templates, funding info
- `docs/` — Project documentation, setup guides, usage, FAQ, images
- `setup.sh` — Script to automate initial setup (e.g., install dependencies)
- `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc` — Configuration files for code style and version control
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE` — Community and legal files

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a new repo from this template.
2. Run `setup.sh` to initialize your project.
3. Update documentation and configuration files as needed.
4. Follow the contributing guidelines for collaboration.

## Extending the Template

- Add your own source code folders (e.g., `src/`, `app/`)
- Customize documentation in `docs/`
- Add CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
