## Using Docker

This template includes a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for easy containerization.

### Build and Run with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t my-app .
   ```
2. **Run the container:**

   ```sh
   # Interactive mode (for development/debugging)
   docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 my-app

   # Detached mode (for background/production use)
   docker run -d --rm -p 3000:3000 my-app
   ```

You can customize the `Dockerfile` to fit your stack (Node.js, React, etc.).

Refer to the `Dockerfile` for details and adjust exposed ports or environment variables as needed.
