# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines individuals or teams that are responsible for code in this repository.
# When someone opens a pull request that modifies code, GitHub will automatically request
# a review from the listed owner(s).

# Default owner for everything in the repository:
*       @Alexandrbig1

# Example: You can add specific owners for directories or files:
# docs/*  @Alexandrbig1
# api/*   @Alexandrbig1
# *.md    @Alexandrbig1

# Note:
# - Multiple owners can be listed (e.g., @Alexandrbig1 @AnotherUser)
# - Teams can also be assigned if your org creates GitHub teams (e.g., @OpenCodeChicago/core-team)
