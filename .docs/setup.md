# Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a new project using this template repository.

## Steps

1. **Create a new repository from this template on GitHub.**

   - Click the "Use this template" button on the template repository page.
   - Name your new repository and set its visibility.

2. **Clone your new repository to your local machine.**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
   cd your-new-repo
   ```

3. **Run the setup script (optional, if present).**

   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```

   This will install dependencies, create a .env file, and run the initial build if applicable.

4. **Customize your project.**

   - Update the README.md with your project details.
   - Remove or edit template files (e.g., docs/setup.md, docs/usage.md, docs/faq.md) as needed.
   - Add your source code and assets.

5. **Commit and push your changes.**

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   git push
   ```

## Tips

- Review and update the LICENSE file if necessary.
- Update the CHANGELOG.md to track your project changes.
- Remove any files or folders you don't need for your project.
